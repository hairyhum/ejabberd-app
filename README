ejabberd - High-Performance Enterprise Instant Messaging Server 

This is a fork of the rebarized version of ejabberd from
https://github.com/esl/ejabberd. The aim of the fork is to split
the two apps ejabberd and stringprep into separate repos to ease
integration of ejabberd into applications that use them as rebar
dependencies.
